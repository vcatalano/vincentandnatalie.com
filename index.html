      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <span class="border"></span>
      <p>Natalie and Vincent met at the beginning of Natalie’s freshman year of college while Vince was starting his senior year.  However, it wasn’t until two years later that Natalie finally landed on Vince’s radar.  By this time, Vince had graduated college and Natalie had just started her junior year.  One day, Gregory, a good friend of the couple, was having a birthday party, and it was at this party that Natalie caught Vince’s eye.  He took notice of her but wasn’t quite sure if he should ask her out on a date so he invited her to church instead.  They went to church together and talked a little here and there.  In the meantime, he talked to their other friend Bridget.  Bridget helped Vince set up a dinner with some of their common friends so that he could talk to her.  This was a challenge given that she was a little school obsessed at the time.  He made chicken parmesan and put on his best hosting abilities to impress her.  Unfortunately, she didn’t get the hints.

      <p>Finally, he decided he’d better just ask her on a date.  Instead of calling her though, he sent her a message on Facebook (thinking that it would be too weird to call her since he never actually got her number).  And then he waited….and waited….and waited...with no response.  He finally decided to call Natalie after getting her number from one of her friends.  No answer.  If she really didn’t like the idea why wouldn’t she just say no?   His friends all tried to encourage him and Bridget tried to tell him she probably hadn’t read it.  He wouldn’t have any of it and was close to giving up.

      <p>After all of that, Bridget had been right all along.  Natalie had been out of town for several weeks, and rarely checked her Facebook.  After a phone call from Bridget forcing Natalie to check her Facebook, she reluctantly did so.  Surprised and flattered she said “Yes”, and then again, on June 30, 2013 when they got engaged on San Francisco Peak in Flagstaff, Arizona.  They will both say yes again to God and each other on January 4, 2014.
